# ECG Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is focused on analyzing Electrocardiogram (ECG) data to classify and differentiate between different types of heart conditions. The dataset includes ECG images from three categories:

1. **Abnormal Heartbeat Patients**: ECG data from patients with abnormal heart rhythms.
2. **Myocardial Infarction Patients**: ECG data from patients who have experienced myocardial infarction (heart attack).
3. **Normal Person**: ECG data from individuals with normal heart rhythms.

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify ECG images into these categories, which can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of heart-related conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset is organized into three main directories, each containing ECG images in `.jpg` format:

- **Input/ECG Data/Abnormal Heartbeat Patients**: Contains ECG images of patients with abnormal heart rhythms.
- **Input/ECG Data/Myocardial Infarction Patients**: Contains ECG images of patients who have experienced myocardial infarction.
- **Input/ECG Data/Normal Person**: Contains ECG images of individuals with normal heart rhythms.

Each category contains multiple ECG images, labeled sequentially (e.g., `HB(1).jpg`, `MI(1).jpg`, `Normal(1).jpg`).

## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

```

├── ECG Data/
│   ├── Abnormal Heartbeat Patients/
│   │   ├── HB(1).jpg
│   │   ├── HB(2).jpg

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For deep learning models (if applicable).
- **OpenCV**: For image processing.

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow opencv-python
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the ECG images from the respective directories.
   - Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization, augmentation) to prepare them for model training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train a machine learning or deep learning model on the preprocessed ECG images.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Test the model on the test set to evaluate its performance.
   - Visualize the results using confusion matrices, ROC curves, etc.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Use the trained model to predict the category of new ECG images.

## Example Code

Here is an example of how to load and preprocess the ECG images:

```python
import os
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load ECG images from a directory
def load_images_from_folder(folder):
    images = []
    for filename in os.listdir(folder):
        img = cv2.imread(os.path.join(folder, filename), cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
        if img is not None:
            images.append(img)
    return images

# Example usage
abnormal_images = load_images_from_folder('Input/ECG Data/Abnormal Heartbeat Patients')
mi_images = load_images_from_folder('Input/ECG Data/Myocardial Infarction Patients')
normal_images = load_images_from_folder('Input/ECG Data/Normal Person')

# Preprocess images (e.g., resize to 128x128)
def preprocess_images(images, size=(128, 128)):
    processed_images = []
    for img in images:
        resized_img = cv2.resize(img, size)
        normalized_img = resized_img / 255.0  # Normalize to [0, 1]
        processed_images.append(normalized_img)
    return np.array(processed_images)

abnormal_images = preprocess_images(abnormal_images)
mi_images = preprocess_images(mi_images)
normal_images = preprocess_images(normal_images)
```

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, you can expect to see results such as:

- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified ECG images.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix showing the true vs. predicted labels.
- **ROC Curve**: A plot showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

## Future Work

- **Data Augmentation**: Increase the dataset size by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, flipping) to the ECG images.
- **Model Optimization**: Experiment with different architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs) and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model as a web or mobile application for real-time ECG classification.
